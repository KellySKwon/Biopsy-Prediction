# Biopsy Prediction USMA Machine Learning Challenge (September 2019)

https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn19323280/wiki/

Cervical cancer, as the fourth most common cause of death from cancer among women, has no symptoms in the early stage. There are multiple cervical screening tests that can help with the diagnosis of cervical cancer, and Biopsy is one of them. In this challenge, you will be given a cervical cancer data set which provides demographic information, habits and historical medical records for patients. The purpose for the challenge is to create a predictive model to see if a biopsy test should be conducted (a binary classification problem) given information about patients, and to find out the important factors leading to a biopsy.

Training data (686 observations and 36 features) and testing data (172 observations and 35 features) will be released at the beginning of the challenge. Each team has 2 free submissions, where the predictions are going to be scored on a fixed 28% of the testing data, and a live leaderboard is available for both free submissions. The final ranking will be determined based on the remaining 72% of the testing data.

F1 score was used as the scoring metric for this data challenge.

RESULT: Received 1st place out of 22 teams with F1-Score of 0.82
